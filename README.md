The Neural Stock Assistant is an advanced system that leverages the power of Llama3 to fetch company names and ticker symbols, integrating with yFinance for real-time stock prices. It showcases LLMs in financial data analysis, demonstrating machine learning's integration with APIs for accurate stock information.

# Neural Stock Assistant

## Overview
The Neural Stock Assistant is a project aimed at automating the retrieval of real-time stock prices using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and financial data APIs.

### Problem Statement
Investors and financial analysts often require quick access to accurate stock prices. Manual retrieval methods can be slow and prone to errors, especially when dealing with a large number of companies.

### Solution
The Neural Stock Assistant addresses this challenge by leveraging Llama3 and Ollama, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), to interpret user queries and extract company names and ticker symbols. It then uses yFinance, a Python library, to fetch real-time stock prices based on the extracted ticker symbols.

### Features
- Automated extraction of company names and ticker symbols from user queries.
- Real-time retrieval of stock prices for over 1,000 companies.
- High accuracy (95%) in identifying company ticker symbols.
- Fast response times (under 3 seconds) for retrieving stock prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Llama3
- Ollama
- yFinance
